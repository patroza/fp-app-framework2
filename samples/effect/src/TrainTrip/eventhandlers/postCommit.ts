// Domain Events should primarily be used to be turned into Integration Event (Post-Commit, call other service)
// There may be other small reasons to use it, like to talk to an external system Pre-Commit.
// Otherwise they just add additional layers of indirection and take behavior away often more suited for the Aggregrates/root.
// Informing other bounded contexts, generally should not occur within the same transaction, and should thus be handled
// by turning into Integration Events.

// Ideas: Store Integration Events into the database within the same Commit, and process them in an outside service.
// So that we may ensure the events will be processed.
// Other options can be to have a compensating action running regularly that checks and fixes things. A sort of eventual consistency.
